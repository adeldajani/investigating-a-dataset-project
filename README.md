This project is from the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program.

This data set compares between 10866 movies based on the actors that were in the movies, the revenue they made, their budget, etc.

we will be studying this data from three areas: 1- the relationship between the run time of the movie and the popularity, 2- the relationship between the budget and the popularity of the movie, 3- how much the budget of movies have changed over the years, and 4- does having a higher revenue means that the movie is more popular?
